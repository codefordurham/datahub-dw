Data Wranglings for the Affordable Housing project

The affordable housing project has a frontend and backend websites: 

Frontend Website Repository - https://github.com/codefordurham/affordablehousing
Backend Website Repository - https://github.com/codefordurham/datahub-be

The frontend was developed using Vue, and contains a web interface that includes
interactive maps developed using D3. The backend was developed using Django Rest 
Framework, and serves data in json format which are used to create the maps on the 
Affordable Housing frontend.

The durham_prop directory contains code that was used to generate the data, from its source 
(i.e. Census, parcel) that was then used in Durham Affordable Housing Project.

The affordablehousing_data directory contains the data used in the datahub_be repository.
